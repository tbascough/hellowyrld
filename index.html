					<h3>Why am I here?</h3>
					<p>
					Ayla, Brock, Van, and Voxre each find a mysterious blue note which, upon opening, has teleported them to a mysterious ghost ship in Wyrld a land of flying islands. While disoriented they quickly ascertain the flying ship is uninhabited and piloting itself. After their investigation, the ghost ship takes them to the town of Peirdawn in Silean, where they are greeted by the new captain of the guard Pelliduppin a gnomish artificer, and his polymount Tiny. Pelliduppin is very interested in studying their now-dormant ship. After a brief investigation of the town Pelliduppin presents them with coin pouches of holding, which will transfer their outwyrlder money into local funds. Before they can discuss further the town is attacked by bandits and fire rains down from the old windmill. The unlikely friends agree to stand with pellideuppen against the raiders

					<h3>Fire anDice</h3>
					<p>
					Fire and Dice. Bandits are attacking Peirdawn, fire is being shot down from the windmill on the cliff above. Ayla ran to help with evacuations while Vandolein Brock and Voxre went to stop whatever is shooting the fire. Alya successfully saved a little girl trapped in a burning building, befriended a strange horse, put out several fires and convinced a sneaky bandit to pee on a fire. She is currently working with a small boy to put out the brewery before the liquor reserves catch fire. The others fought bravely at the windmill, quickly dispatching the bandits. They found a hidden room with chests and stolen gold in the windmill as well as a sickly bandit who Van took hostage. Brock stepped right in a trap but tanked it like a champ and still used his earth bending might to shatter a door. Brock and Voxre hear a slight buzzing as they approach the door upstairs and prepare to stop whatever is causing the fires.

					<h3>Hoggin the Spotlight</h3>
					<p>
					Ayla put out the last fire, rescued the escaped horses and calmed the people before heading off to help her friends in the windmill. meanwhile Brock opened a door and disappeared in a magical explosion, his fate is yet unknown to the others. Voxre was knocked unconscious by the blast, leaving Van to face the danger alone. He courageously fought a pair of mad fire pixie but was eventually transformed into a wild hog who broke down a wall, fell downstairs, climbed up a latter and got stuck in a whole. 
					<br><br>
					Ayla climbed through the window just as Voxre recovered and dispatched the first pixie. Van returned to his natural form when the pixie died and, still smelling a bit of hog, shot an arrow at the other pixie. ever the optimist, Ayla jumped in front of the arrow and the pixie fled turning invisible. Van grumpily headed back to town as the group discovered that the fire pixies had been imprisoned by the bandits to be used against the town. but the pixies turned torturing and eventually killing their bandit captors. Alya at last made peace with the hidden pixie who could not fly over the spilled puddles of water as was thus trapped in the tower. Voxre charged through a wall allowing the fire pixie to escape. It flew off over to woods to reek havoc elsewhere, waving a fond, if gruff farewell to it's new unexpected friends

					<h3>I cAnt believe it</h3>
					<p>
					Brock fell from the sky landing in a crater the surprised but victorious  heros enjoyed some fine ale and a good nights sleep at the swanky plank. after a bit of shopping and mingling with the locals they met with the mayor and pelliduppin at his workshop.  tinkering with the ship revealed that it was designed to make one pre-determined flight, someone brought them here on purpose. Pelliduppin thinks he could salvage enough parts for a small functional skiff if they could get more sapphires for fuel. 
					<br><br>
					The Mayor  was troubled by the discovery of the fire pixies. The bandits are getting more bold and there are whispers of a larger criminal organization out of Traidstyl. Something seems to be corrupting the feywoods and the bandits are capitalizing on the disruption. The heros agreed to help root out the problem in exchange for the repaired boat and set out to the north in search of clues. 
					<br><br>
					They were not long on the road before noticing strange movements in the woods. Ayla, empowered by the moon spirit, shape changed  into an ant and found out that something in the trees has been disturbing local wildlife. The ants told of a nearby farm thats giving less food than normal, a camp in the woods with lots of people, and overall much more activity in the feywood than was normal. Ayla changed back and shared her finding the crew who were nervous about the surrounding trees but Van confidently slapped a nearby tree "how mad can a tree be?"

					<h3>Tongue-Twister</h3>
					<p>
					The party finds themselves battling a group of blights along the road. Needles rained from unseen foes as woody tumors pulled away from trees to attack. Brock knocked the needle blight from it's perch and Ayla's vine magic ensnared it. Voxre and Van attacked with blade and gaffe. The party, with some trepidation, emerged victorious. They headed north and found a recently destroyed farm infested with undead. Ayla took a weasel's form and snuck into the ruined house. But her shapechanging powers were still new and she was immediately spotted by a fearsom Ghast, a stinking powerful undead child with a tounge that dragged on the floor. It Attacked her vicously while the others fought gouhls outside. Brock fell as a gouhl chewed through his leg. Van and Voxre leaped to his aid and dispatched the beast rescueing Brock. The heros prevailed, bloody and bruised, but victorious once again. Ayla managed to save Brocks leg with the last of her magic and Brock set up defences with the last of his. The tired heros made camp in the abandoned ruins. They found the child's journal and hand drawm map detailing recent activity in the woods. In the morning they will set forth on the morn, following the undead child's map, in search of bandits and whatever strange happenings are befouling the feywood.
